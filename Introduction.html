<p class="text">Hello all. I live in Eau Claire, Wisconsin with my husband and our ten month old son. We have an Airedale Terrier, Gizmo, and a cat, Oliver.
I taught middle and high school social studies for nine years until I resigned in the Spring of 2019 to stay home with our son while
obtaining my graduate degree.
I am a second year student the LIS program. However, since I only attend part time, I don't anticipate graduating until 2023.
Upon graduation, I am hoping to reenter the workforce as a school librarian.
Although my free time is in much shorter supply than it used to be, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and baking when I am not chasing after my son.
My husband and I also love to travel and are looking forward to using our passports again when it is safe to do so.</p>
<p class="text">Since we had three members in our group, it felt inauthentic to have one person assume the role of interviewer
for the assignment. Instead, we decided to take turns introducing ourselves then discuss our tech hero.
We were all prepared and felt comfortable interacting with one another. </p>
<p class="text">Although there was certainly some frustration with the seemingly constant technological issues, we worked together to try and find solutions. All three
group members offered suggestions and patiently encouraged each other. We supported one another and did not let our frustrations impact the work we were trying to do.</p>

<p class="text">Hey, I'm Natalie Larimer. I'm a second-year graduate student in the Distance MLIS program of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br> I'm originally from Des Moines, IA, but I currently live in Rochester, NY with my boyfriend while he does his PhD in Computer Science.</p>

		<p class="text">While attmepting to complete Assignment #1, we hit a number of snags. From what I remember, we started by using Google Hangouts I believe, but then<br> couldn't figure out how to do a video recording on there, so we moved to Zoom. There, for some reason Elizabeth wasn't able to hear us, so we moved back <br> to Google Hangouts. Once there, Elizabeth's audio started working but Sarah's went out. We were sending files and links through Google Hangouts<br> Chat and Zoom Chat to try and troubleshoot. It was my idea to have both Google Hangouts video <em>and</em> Zoom video at the same time, which was<br> fairly operational so we could at least talk to each other. I tried to record the Zoom meeting, since I was the only one able to hear everybody's audio,<br> but once the interview ended, the file it saved was refusing to open. It was a .zoom file, which I've never seen before, and it I tried to open it on<br> several apps to no avail. Then I emailed it to Elizabeth to see if she could open it on her computer, and no luck. So we ended up having to redo the<br> <em>entire interview</em> over another Zoom call that <em>luckily</em> Elizabeth was able to save properly.</p>
		<p class="text">Long story short, it was a mess. But we did it! <b><em>HOORAY!</em></b></p>

<p class="text">I am a second-year iSchool student, and I live and work in Minneapolis with my three turtles. I work at a medical library for a large health system in the twin cities. When I have free time, I enjoy embroidery, reading, and yoga. I also love traveling, in this picture I am on a goat hike in Joshua Tree this January. In this course I am hoping to become more confident in coding and not to be intimidated by it. My favorite thing in tech right now is actually Instagram live, I have been using it nearly every day during lockdown as a way to work out. Being able to do workouts with other people on Instagram live gives the feel of being in a gym, without other peoples germs. </p>

 <p class="text"> Our group initially started out as Elizabeth and me; however, about two hours before we recorded our interview, we noticed that our discussion group was missing a member and Natalie needed a group. We invited her in. Elizabeth, Natalie, and I interviewed each other through many different formats before figuring out how to save and upload the video. We tried to use Google Hangouts, Google Meets, and Zoom twice. Zoom ended up being the only format we were able to record in. After muplitple times of losing one person we were finally able to record and upload a viable video. Many of the issues that we ran into steamed from being unfamiliar with the programs we were using. </p>

	<p class="text">Rehmsa Saujani has always liked a challenge. The Illinois
	native and daughter of Indian refugees understood the impact education could have on
	her future. She graduated from Harvard Law School and spent several years working as
  an attorney in a private firm. Feeling unfulfilled professionally, Saujani became the first South Asian woman to run for
  Congress in 2010. Despite losing, the election marked a turning point for Saujani. She left the private sector and started
  the international nonprofit organization Girls Who Code.</p>

    <p class="text">The results are telling. Gils Who Code has 8,500 clubs worldwide and has reached over 300,000 girls.

	<p class="sansserif"> Rehmsa Saujani has always liked a challenge. The Illinois 
	native and daughter of Indian refugees understood the impact education could have on 
	her future. She graduated from Harvard Law School and spent several years working as
    an attorney in a private firm. Feeling unfulfilled professionally, Saujani became the first South Asian woman to run for
    Congress in 2010. Despite losing, the election marked a turning point for Saujani. She left the private sector and started
    the international nonprofit organization Girls Who Code.</p>

    <p class="sansserif"> Reshma Saujani is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code. The organization's goal is
    to close the gap in who creates technology and shift the image of what a computer programmer
    looks like to include women and people of color. The organization organizes an afterschool club for girls in grades 3-12 to introduce coding. They also host a two week summer program for high school girls. Additionally, they implement college programs to connect students and alumni with other women in technology.</p>
    
    <p class="sansserif"> The results are telling. Gils Who Code has 8,500 clubs worldwide and has reached over 300,000 girls. Girls Who Code is focusing on ensuring girls from underrepresented groups have access to quality STEM programs. The groups is expanding into creating curriculum and advocating policy changes to further their goals.

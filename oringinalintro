<p class="sansserif">Hello all. I live in Eau Claire, Wisconsin with my husband and our ten month old son. We have an Airedale Terrier, Gizmo, and a cat, Oliver.
I taught middle and high school social studies for nine years until I resigned in the Spring of 2019 to stay home with our son while
obtaining my graduate degree.
I am a second year student the LIS program. However, since I only attend part time, I don't anticipate graduating until 2023.
Upon graduation, I am hoping to reenter the workforce as a school librarian.
Although my free time is in much shorter supply than it used to be, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and baking when I am not chasing after my son.
My husband and I also love to travel and are looking forward to using our passports again when it is safe to do so.</p>

<h2 class="sansserif">Assignment 1</h2>

<div class="b">
<p class="sansserif">Since we had three members in our group, it felt inauthentic to have one person assume the role of interviewer
for the assignment. Instead, we decided to take turns introducing ourselves then discuss our tech hero.
We were all prepared and felt comfortable interacting with one another. </p>

<p class="sansserif">We did encounter some technical difficulties. We organized when and how we were going to meet and record through Google Hangouts.
Initially, we planned on using Elizabeth's Zoom account to record the assignment. However, there were some audio issues on Elizabeth's end.
We attempted to circumvent the issue by having Natalie record the Zoom meeting and send the file to Elizabeth to upload. However, we were unable to open the file.
After unsuccessfully searching for another medium to record the assignment, we tried Zoom a second time. Elizabeth was able to solve the audio issue and was able to
successfully record on our second attempt. As the Zoom account owner, this made it much easier to record and upload the assignment.</p>

<p class="sansserif">Although there was certainly some frustration with the seemingly constant technological issues, we worked together to try and find solutions. All three
group members offered suggestions and patiently encouraged each other. We supported one another and did not let our frustrations impact the work we were trying to do.</p>
